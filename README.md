In the Desktop folder, usernames.html was the first thing I wrote while learning Javascript. I wanted to see if I could 
use an array to keep track of usernames and passwords. I did not try to save the array to a file after each run, but just 
wanted to see what I could do with my initial lessons of Javascript. 



In /Desktop/COLLEGE/Programming/JavaMultiThreading, I have a project assigned to me by my Intoduction to Computer Science 
porofessor. He slected me to write a program exhibiting Multi-Threading. The program was presented at NYU's programming 
showcase as a representative of the entire university's Intorduction to Computer Science course level.
